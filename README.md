# 🏗️ Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

## 📌 Description
This project predicts the **compressive strength of concrete** based on its ingredients (cement, water, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, fly ash, etc.) and curing age.  
Using **Random Forest and XGBoost**, the model achieved **R² = 0.93** and **RMSE = 4.6 MPa**, making it a reliable tool for material quality prediction.
